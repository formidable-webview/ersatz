==== Shared Props

This is a support overview for https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview/blob/master/src/WebViewTypes.ts[`WebViewSharedProps`] in this library.

===== Behavior Props

[width="100%",options="header"]
|===
| Prop | Support | Origin | Comments

| `javaScriptEnabled`
| :heavy_check_mark:
| Any
| Ignored when `sandboxEnabled` set to `false`.

| `containerStyle`
| :heavy_check_mark:

| Default styling is guaranteed strictly equivalent with community `WebView` for mobile
platforms.

| `style`
| :heavy_check_mark:
| Any
| Default styling is guaranteed strictly equivalent with community `WebView` for mobile
platforms.

| `renderError`
| :heavy_check_mark:
|  Any
| Because HTTP requests from the browser cannot be accessed for obvious
security reasons, and `onerror` events are not triggered on iframes in modern
browsers, we use a little trick: we send an opaque HTTP HEAD request to the
resource, and catch an error when the host is unavailable. You can disable this
feature by setting `errorRenderingEnabled` to `false`.
